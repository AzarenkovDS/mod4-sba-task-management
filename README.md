# SBA 4: Task Management App

## Reflection:
- Challenges faced during the project.
- How you approached solving those challenges.
- What you would improve if given more time.

One of the main challenges I faced in this project was implementing the filtering logic and working with dates. Comparing user input deadlines to the current date and updating task statuses based on that wasn't as straightforward as I expected. I relied on JavaScript documentation and looked through solutions on platforms like StackOverflow to figure out how to handle date parsing and comparisons properly.
If I had more time, I'd improve the UI a bit, maybe by adding visual indicators for overdue tasks and using a more structured layout.
